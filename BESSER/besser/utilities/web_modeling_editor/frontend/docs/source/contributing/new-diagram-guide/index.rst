Adding a New Diagram Type
=========================

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for adding a new diagram type to the BESSER web modeling editor. It covers the entire stack: from the frontend UI (React/TypeScript) to the backend processing (Python/FastAPI).

Adding a new diagram involves changes in three main areas:

1.  **Editor Package**: Defining the metamodel, rendering components, and palette configuration.
2.  **Web Application (webapp2)**: Ensuring the new diagram type is recognized by the project store (if needed).
3.  **Backend**: Creating a processor to convert the diagram JSON into BUML objects for code generation.

Decision Tree
-------------

* If the diagram type already exists in the editor package (``packages/editor``), you only need the **webapp wiring**
  (sidebar, project model, import/export labels). Use the checklist in
  ``packages/webapp2/src/main/features/project/ADDING_NEW_DIAGRAM_TYPE.md``.
* If the diagram type is brand new, you must update **editor package + webapp2 + backend**.
