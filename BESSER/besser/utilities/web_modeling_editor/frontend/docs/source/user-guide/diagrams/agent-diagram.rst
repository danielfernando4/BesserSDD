Agent Diagrams
==============

Agent diagrams are used to design conversational agents and their behaviors, supporting the definition of
`agent models <https://besser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/buml_language/model_types/agent.html>`_.

Agent States
------------

AgentStates represent the different conditions or statuses that an agent can be in.

Double-click an AgentState to edit its body:

Options for the body:

*   **Text Reply**: Static text sent as a reply.
*   **LLM Reply**: Generates a reply using a Large Language Model based on user input.
*   **Python Code**: Executes custom Python code (must take ``session`` as an argument).

Transitions
-----------

Transitions define how the agent moves between states. Supported conditions:

*   **When Intent Matched**: Occurs when a specific user intent is recognized.
*   **When No Intent Matched**: Fallback when no intent is recognized.
*   **Variable Operation Matched**: Checks if a session variable meets a condition.
*   **File Received**: Occurs when a specific file type is uploaded.
*   **Auto Transition**: Occurs automatically after the state action completes.

Intents
-------

Intents represent the user's goals or vocabulary. Each intent requires a name and a list of training sentences.

Generating the Agent
--------------------

Once designed, you can generate a deployable agent:

1.  Click **Generate Code**.
2.  Select **BESSER Agent**.
3.  Choose the **Source Language** (of your model) and **Target Language** (for the agent's communication).

Supported languages include English, German, Spanish, French, Luxembourgish, and Portuguese.
