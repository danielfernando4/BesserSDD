                    type</code>, <code>+ attribute</code>, or simply <code>attribute</code>, where the type can be a
                  primitive data type (int, float, str, bool, time, date, datetime, timedelta, or any) or a class/enum type. The default type is string.
                  Visibility can be set using <code>+</code> (public), <code>-</code> (private), or <code>#</code> (protected),

                  of type <code>str</code> and a default value of <code>'message'</code>. Another example, <code>- findBook(title: str): Book</code>,
                  represents a private method named <code>findBook</code> that takes a title parameter of type <code>str</code> and
                  returns a <code>Book</code>. A method without parameters, such as <code>validate()</code>, would be defined
                  as public by default.

                  and provide realistic attribute values to make the diagram more understandable.

                 Click on the outer part of the agent state element and drag it to another agent state element to create a transition. For a given state, this will allow you to specify the possible transitions.

                  Double-click on a transition to open a popup where you can define the condition for the transition. The condition is a boolean expression that determines when the transition should occur. You can use the following elements in the condition:
                  <ul>
                    <li>When Intent Matched: transition when a specified intent is recognized</li>
                    <li>When No Intent Matched: transition if no intent fits </li>
                    <li>Variable Operation Matched: transition when stored user session variable fullfills criteria </li>
                    <li>File Received: transition when a file is received </li>

                <td>
                  To define your starting agent state, connect the initial state element to the agent state you want to start with. The initial state is the first state the agent will enter when it is activated.

                <td>
                  To define the intents your agent is supposed to recognize, drag and drop the intent element from the left panel onto the canvas. You can then double-click on the intent element to open a popup where you can define the intent name and its training sentences. The training sentences are the phrases that users might say to trigger this intent. The description is used to describe the purpose or idea behind the intent.

                 To configure the agent's settings, such as the underlying LLM model or RAG database, you can select the agent configuration page in the sidebar. Here, you can select which technologies and techniques the agent should use:
                    <ul>
                  <li>Classical intent-recognition: a local tensorflow model will be trained using the defined intents</li>
                  <li> LLM-based intent-recognition: an (external or internal) LLM will be used to recognize intents </li>
                </ul>
